scanalytics is a Python implementation of several analyses used in Supply Chain
Analytics & Design. The goal of writing this program is to programmatically
solve problems encountered in some Supply Chain Analytics and Design class
assignments, thus minimizing tedious manual work in spreadsheet.

`git clone https://github.com/lmarkely/scanalytics.git`

# Notes
This is by no means a complete collection of all analyses. There are other
repositories that cover Python implementation other analyses, e.g. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://gist.github.com/econchick/4666413).
